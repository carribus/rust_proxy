# rust_proxy

*WARNING* This project contains code that was never intended to be used as anything more than a learning exercise for myself.

With this in mind, the idea behind this was to build a small proxy server in Rust that was (initially) able to proxy HTTP(S) calls. The code in this repo should _always_ be considered unstable and unusable :)
